# What's the goal?
- Basically like those tamagotchi toys, but instead it's on a site.

# But it's hosted Static?
- Yes, everyone and i mean anyone can just either __delete__ or __leave the data alone__
- Anyone can delete the data if they figure out how, as i won't be adding any security measures
- Why so? there won't be any Authentication so there's basically no point in adding security for basic data.

# Opensource
- This site is completely opensourced, free to use for everyone.
